# 👋 Hi, I'm Thadoe Hein  

💡 **AI Engineer | Applied Machine Learning | Generalist Problem Solver**

I’m a generalist who uses AI to tackle complex problems across NLP, computer vision, and automation.  
Whenever I face a challenge, I leverage AI tools to accelerate ideation, coding, and deployment — turning ideas into working systems fast.

---

### 🧠 What I Do
- Design and deploy **end-to-end AI solutions** using PyTorch, HuggingFace, and AWS  
- Build and experiment with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **face search**, and **document understanding**  
- Automate workflows and pipelines where humans get bored and machines don’t  
- Adapt quickly across domains — using AI as both a coding partner and an amplifier of creativity  

---

### ⚙️ My Current Toolkit
`Python` • `LangChain` • `HuggingFace` • `PyTorch` • `Docker` • `AWS` • `Next.js`  
*(I don’t code everything from scratch — I integrate, automate, and optimize.)*

---

### 🌍 About Me
- B.Sc. in Computer Science, **Assumption University of Thailand** (GPA 3.69)  
- Experience in **NLP**, **Generative AI**, **MLOps**, and **low-resource language models**  
- I enjoy building AI systems that **actually run in production**, not just look good in papers

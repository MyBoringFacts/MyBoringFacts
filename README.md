# 👋 Hi, I'm Thadoe Hein  

💡 **AI Engineer | Applied Machine Learning | Generalist Problem Solver**

I’m a generalist who uses AI to tackle complex problems across NLP, computer vision, and automation.  
Whenever I face a challenge, I leverage AI tools to accelerate ideation, coding, and deployment — turning ideas into working systems fast.

What I Do

Develop and deploy end-to-end machine learning and AI systems using PyTorch, Hugging Face, and AWS
Design and implement RAG pipelines, face recognition systems, and intelligent document processing solutions
Build and optimize data and model pipelines for scalability, automation, and real-world deployment
Experiment across domains — leveraging AI as a co-creator to accelerate development and innovation

### ⚙️ My Current Toolkit
`Python` • `LangChain` • `HuggingFace` • `PyTorch` • `Docker` • `AWS` • `Next.js`  
*(I don’t code everything from scratch — I integrate, automate, and optimize.)*

---

### 🌍 About Me
- B.Sc. in Computer Science, **Assumption University of Thailand** (GPA 3.69)  
- Experience in **NLP**, **Generative AI**, **AIOps**, and **language models**  
- I enjoy building AI systems that **actually run in production**, not just look good in papers
